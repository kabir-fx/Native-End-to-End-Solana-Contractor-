This repository contains native solana programs and their respective tests to understand the concept of CPIs in Solana. It consists of 2 programs:

- counter.rs: holds the logic to increment the data present in the data account.

- cpi.rs: holds the logic to establish a CPI and enable it to forward the data account.

This implementation serves as a great foundation to later incorporate PDAs with CPIs.
